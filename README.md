# Zing-Onboarding
Tutorials for Learning the Zing Tech Stack

## React-Tutorial
A simple tic-tac-toe game made using react js following the tutorial from [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I'm doing this to learn the front-end portion of the Zing tech stack and get a better grasp of React.

## Express-Tutorial
Some basic Express js routes using different http request methods following the documentation from [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html). I'm doing this to learn part of the back-end of the Zing tech stack, since I haven't worked with express js in the past.
